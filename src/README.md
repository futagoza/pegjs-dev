PEG.js is a simple parser generator for JavaScript that produces fast parsers
with excellent error reporting. You can use it to process complex data or
computer languages and build transformers, interpreters, compilers and other
tools easily.

## About This Module (pegjs-dev)

1) This NPM module is simply the current development version hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs),
which includes all git commits made since the last release. You can tell how many
commits have been made since the release by looking at the 'patch' number in the
version string: '0.9.0-66' means 66 commits.

2) As of 04 July 2016 I have decided to merge changes when any of the following conditions are met:

    * The PEG.js parser is regenerated
    * Parser generator (the compiler) is updated
    * I'm currently using PEG.js via [pegjs-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pegjs-dev)

3) Before 18 July 2016, whenever I updated this module, the version was changed to '0.9.(...)', but now its '0.9.0-(...)'
