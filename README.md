PEG.js is a simple parser generator for JavaScript that produces fast parsers with excellent error reporting. You can use it to process complex data or computer languages and build transformers, interpreters, compilers and other tools easily.

## about this repository

1) This Node.js module help's release the tagged `dev` version of PEG.js on NPM.

2) Each release is simply the current development version of PEG.js hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs), which includes all git commits made since the last major release. You can tell how many commits have been made since the last release by looking at the number proceeding the `dev` tag in the version string: `0.11.0-dev.72` means 72 commits have been made since `0.10.0`

2) I usually update the tagged `dev` version whenever:

    * The PEG.js parser is regenerated
    * Parser generator (the compiler) is updated
    * A new feature is implemented
